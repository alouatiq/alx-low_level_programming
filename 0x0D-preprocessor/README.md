# Preprocessor Project

This project demonstrates the use of preprocessor directives in C to create macros and handle common preprocessing tasks.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Object-like Macro
Create a header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.

**File:** `0-object_like_macro.h`
```c
#ifndef OBJECT_LIKE_MACRO_H
#define OBJECT_LIKE_MACRO_H

#define SIZE 1024

#endif /* OBJECT_LIKE_MACRO_H */
