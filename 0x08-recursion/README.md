# 0x08. C - Recursion

This project covers various functions implemented using recursion in C. Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. This project includes functions for string manipulation, mathematical computations, and more.

## Description

The aim of this project is to understand and implement the concept of recursion. Recursion provides a powerful tool for solving problems by breaking them down into simpler sub-problems.

## Files

- `0-puts_recursion.c`: Function to print a string followed by a new line.
- `1-print_rev_recursion.c`: Function to print a string in reverse.
- `2-strlen_recursion.c`: Function to return the length of a string.
- `3-factorial.c`: Function to return the factorial of a given number.
- `4-pow_recursion.c`: Function to return the value of `x` raised to the power of `y`.
- `5-sqrt_recursion.c`: Function to return the natural square root of a number.
- `6-is_prime_number.c`: Function to check if a number is prime.
- `100-is_palindrome.c`: Function to check if a string is a palindrome.
- `101-wildcmp.c`: Function to compare two strings with wildcard character `*`.

## Usage

Here are examples of how to compile and run each function:

### 0-puts_recursion.c

Function to print a string followed by a new line.

```c
#include "main.h"

int main(void)
{
    _puts_recursion("Puts with recursion");
        return (0);
	}
