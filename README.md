## Introduction

Hello, World! Welcome to my GitHub repository, **alx-low_level_programming**. This repository is dedicated to the low-level programming projects as part of the ALX Software Engineering program. Here, you'll find various projects and exercises that delve into the fundamentals of C programming, offering a hands-on approach to learning this powerful language.

## Why C Programming?

C is often called the mother of all programming languages, and for good reason. Developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs, C has influenced many modern languages like C++, C#, and even Python. Its efficiency, flexibility, and close-to-the-metal capabilities make it an ideal choice for system programming, game development, and applications requiring real-time processing.

### Key Figures in C Programming

- **Dennis Ritchie:** Co-creator of Unix and the C programming language.
- **Brian Kernighan:** Co-author of "The C Programming Language" book, also known as K&R.
- **Linus Torvalds:** Creator of Linux, a massive advocate for C programming.

## Project Objectives

By the end of this project, you will:

- Understand why C programming is awesome.
- Know the history and key figures in C programming.
- Be able to explain the C compilation process and the role of the `gcc` compiler.
- Write and compile C programs using `gcc`.
- Use `printf`, `puts`, and `putchar` to print text.
- Utilize the `sizeof` operator to determine the size of data types.
- Follow and apply the Betty coding style.
- Manage headers and libraries in your C programs effectively.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started with the project, you need the following:

- A Unix-like operating system (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS recommended)
- Basic understanding of terminal commands
- Text editor (e.g., `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`)
