# Project: 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

## Description
This project is part of the ongoing second chance assignments in C, focusing on fundamental concepts like variables, conditional statements (`if`, `else`), and loops (`while`). The project aims to solidify understanding of these concepts through practical coding exercises.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you should be able to:
- Explain arithmetic operators and use them in C.
- Understand and utilize logical operators (boolean operators).
- Describe relational operators and their usage.
- Define TRUE and FALSE values in C.
- Implement `if`, `if...else` statements effectively.
- Utilize comments, declare variables (`char`, `int`, `unsigned int`), and assign values to them.
- Print variable values using `printf`.
- Use the `while` loop and integrate variables with it.
- Understand the ASCII character set.
- Know the purpose of gcc flags `-m32` and `-m64`.
